# How to Download Assassin's Creed Rogue for Free
 
Assassin's Creed Rogue is a 2014 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Sofia and published by Ubisoft. It is the seventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and is set between 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and 2012's Assassin's Creed III. It also has ties to Assassin's Creed Unity, which was released on the same day as Rogue.
 
The game follows the story of Shay Patrick Cormac, an Irish American privateer and Assassin, who defects to the Templars and helps them hunt down members of his former Brotherhood after becoming disillusioned with their tactics. The game features three main areas: the western North Atlantic, the fictional River Valley, and New York City. The gameplay is very similar to that of Black Flag, with a mixture of ship-based naval exploration and third-person land-based exploration, though some new features have been added.

If you are interested in playing this game, you might be wondering how to download it for free. There are several ways to do this, but not all of them are safe or legal. In this article, we will explain some of the methods that you can use to get Assassin's Creed Rogue for free, as well as their pros and cons.
  
## Method 1: Steam
 
Steam is a digital distribution platform that offers a variety of games, including Assassin's Creed Rogue. Steam often has sales and discounts on its games, which can lower the price significantly. Sometimes, Steam even offers free weekends or free trials for certain games, which allow you to play them for a limited time without paying anything.
 
To use this method, you will need to create a Steam account and download the Steam client on your computer. Then, you can browse the Steam store and look for Assassin's Creed Rogue. If it is on sale or has a free offer, you can add it to your library and download it. You will need to have enough space on your hard drive and a stable internet connection to download the game.
 
The pros of this method are:

- It is legal and safe. You will not risk getting viruses or malware from downloading the game.
- You will get access to all the features and updates of the game, as well as Steam achievements and community support.
- You will be able to play online with other players who have the game on Steam.

The cons of this method are:

- It is not always available. You will have to wait for a sale or a free offer to get the game for free.
- You will need a Steam account and a Steam client to play the game.
- You will need a good internet connection to download and play the game.

## Method 2: Torrents
 
Torrents are files that contain information about other files that are shared by users over a peer-to-peer network. By using a torrent client, such as BitTorrent or uTorrent, you can download these files from other users who have them on their computers. Some of these files may contain cracked versions of Assassin's Creed Rogue, which are modified to bypass the security measures and allow you to play the game without paying for it.
 
To use this method, you will need to find a torrent file that contains Assassin's Creed Rogue. You can search for it on various torrent websites, such as The Pirate Bay or Kickass Torrents. However, you should be careful about what you download, as some torrents may be fake or contain viruses or malware. You should also check the comments and ratings of other users who have downloaded the torrent before you do so. Once you have found a reliable torrent, you can download it using your torrent client and then install the game on your computer.
 
The pros of this method are:

- It is easy and fast. You can download the game in a matter of minutes or hours depending on your internet speed and the availability of seeders (users who share the file).
- You do not need any account or client to play the game.
- You can play offline without any internet connection.

The cons of this method are:

- It is illegal and risky. You may violate the intellectual property rights of Ubisoft and face legal consequences. You may also expose your computer to viruses or malware that can harm your system or steal your personal information.
- You will not get access to any updates or features of the game that require online connection, such as multiplayer mode or DLCs.
- You may experience bugs or glitches in the game that are not fixed by the developers.

## Method 3: Key Generators
 
Key generators are programs that generate random codes or keys that can be used to activate certain games or software. Some of these programs may claim to generate keys for Assassin's Creed Rogue, which you can use to redeem the game on platforms such as Steam, Uplay, or Origin.
 
To use this method, you will need to find a key generator that works for Assassin's Creed Rogue. You can search for it on various websites or forums, but you should be wary of scams or fake programs that may contain viruses or malware. You should also check the feedback of other users who have used the program before you do so. Once you have found a trustworthy key generator, you can download it and run it on your computer. Then, you can copy the generated key and use it to redeem the game on your preferred platform.
 
The pros of this method are:

- It is simple and quick. You can get the game for free in a matter of seconds or minutes.
- You will get access to all the features and updates of the game, as well as achievements and community support.
- You will be able to play online with other players who have the game on the same platform.

The cons of this method are:

- It is illegal and unreliable. You may violate the terms of service of Ubisoft and the platform you use and face legal consequences. You may also get banned from the platform or lose access to the game if the key is detected as invalid or fraudulent.
- You may expose your computer to viruses or malware that can harm your system or steal your personal information.
- You may not find a working key generator for Assassin's Creed Rogue, as they are often patched or taken down by Ubisoft or the platform providers.

## Conclusion
 
Assassin's Creed Rogue is a great game that offers an exciting and unique perspective on the Assassin-Templar conflict. However, if you want to play it for free, you will have to choose between different methods that have their own advantages and disadvantages. The safest and most legal way is to wait for a sale or a free offer on Steam, but you will need a Steam account and a good internet connection to do so. The easiest and fastest way is to use a key generator, but you will risk getting banned or infected by viruses or malware. The most flexible and offline way is to use torrents, but you will violate the intellectual property rights of Ubisoft and miss out on online features and updates.
 
Ultimately, the choice is yours, but we recommend that you support the developers and buy the game if you can afford it. You will not only enjoy a high-quality game, but also help Ubisoft create more amazing games in the future.
